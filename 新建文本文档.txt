Dear Mr.Sun,
	How is it going? I write the letter to express my gratitude to you.
	Three years ago, when I entered the high school, it was you who led me to begin my new school life. And just several years before, you sent me away contentedly. What you paid for me will never be forgotten.
	It was in a summer morning when I suddenly had a serious fever and a stomachache. You came to the classroom as soon as you heard the news. What's more, you dialed to ask me about my condition after I went to hospital, which really made me feel warm. And after the final test of the Grade 2, I got an indeed poor grade. You called me to your office, let me know that you didn't give up me and what I should do is just to get myself adjusted. Without your encouraging words, how I can get the qualification for the WHUT!
	Time travels fast, but true love won't be lost. No matter how beautiful the words are, my gratitude can't be expressed enough. Let me sincerely say: "Thank you!"
